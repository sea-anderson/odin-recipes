    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This red sauce is made with canned tomatoes and uses
        italian sausage and anchovies to provide a ton of flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (yellow or white)</li>
        <li>4-6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2-3 cans of anchovy fillets (retain oil)</li>
        <li>1 lb italian sausage (sweet or hot)</li>
        <li>2 28-ounce cans of crushed tomoatoes</li>
        <li>1 14-ounce can of chopped tomoatoes</li>
        <li>Dried italian spices (oregano, thyme, basil)</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh-ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Finely chop the onion and add it to a large pot
        </li>
        <li>
            Add a generous amount of olive oil and cook on medium high until beginning to soften
        </li>
        <li>
            While the onion is beginning to cook mince your garlic
        </li>
        <li>
            After the onion has begun to soften (about 5-7 min) add the minced garlic, the dried herbs
            and the anchovy fillets with their oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the garlic begins to get fragrant (1-2 min) add the sausage.
            If you got sausage links you can either remove it from the casing or 
            just chop it into smaller pieces and add it.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the sausage has begun to brown the anchovy fillets should be mostly or 
            completely broken down. At this point add all of the tomatoes to the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the heat down to low and let the sauce simmer for about 2 hours
        </li>
        <li>
            The sauce can be used right away or it can be frozen for later. It 
            will keep in the fridge for about 2 weeks.
        </li>
    </ol>
